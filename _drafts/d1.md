I need to keep my signing keystore secure for my Android project, but I want to open source the code.

How many times have I pushed a [git](/definition/git) tag to GitHub and then realized that I made a mistake? Too many to count. It is kind of embarrassing. Fortunately it is not frequent enough that I have memorized how to delete that tag.

So write it down.
-----------------

Assuming that you just pushed a tag named ```0.7.8``` to ```origin```. You can delete it doing the following:

{% highlight bash %}
openssl base64 -A -in keystore.jks | pbcopy
{% endhighlight %}

{% highlight bash %}
echo $KEYSTORE_BASE64 | base64 --decode > keystore.jks
{% endhighlight %}

Simple.
